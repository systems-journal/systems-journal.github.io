        <h1>Call for Papers</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <p>A submitted paper should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work
            and
            its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions, and outline the
            key
            technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A submission should strive to be accessible to
            a
            broad audience, as well as having sufficient details for experts in the area.</p>
        <p>
            Format and length requirements for submissions are stated below. All ideas necessary for an expert to fully
            verify the central claims in a paper, including experimental results, should be included in the submission.
        </p>
        <p>
            Submissions not conforming to the rules stated in this call, as well as papers outside the scope of the
            conference, may be rejected without consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Submissions must be prepared using the following templates:
        <ul>
            <li>LaTeX (link)</li>
            <li>Microsoft Word (link)</li>
            <li>Markdown (link)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Regular paper submissions may be up to 6 pages long, excluding references, and may be followed by a clearly
            marked appendix.
        </p>
        <p>We allow to submit short papers about work in progress of up to 2 pages long, excluding references.
        </p>
        <p>Best practices for citations: Alphabetical orderings of authors can lead to biases. Therefore, authors are
            encouraged to avoid “et al.” in citations, and instead mention all authors’ names.</p>

            Submissions should be done through the website:

        <h4>Reviewing</h4>

        <p>The journal will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the
            identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should
            not appear anywhere in the submission. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the
            submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references
            should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or
            draft versions of their paper as they normally would.For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on
            the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on
            double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the representatives of the journal by email.
