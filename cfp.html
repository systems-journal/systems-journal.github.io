            <h4>Paper submission</h4>
            <p>A submitted paper should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior
                work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions, and outline
                the keytechnical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A submission should strive to be accessible
                to a broad audience, as well as having sufficient details for experts in the area.</p>
            <p>
                Format and length requirements for submissions are stated below. All ideas necessary for an expert to
                fully
                verify the central claims in a paper, including experimental results, should be included in the
                submission.
            </p>
            <p>
                Submissions not conforming to the rules stated in this call, as well as papers outside the scope of the
                conference, may be rejected without consideration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Submissions must be prepared using the following templates:
            <ul>
                <li>LaTeX (link)</li>
                <li>Microsoft Word (link)</li>
                <li>Markdown (link)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Regular paper submissions may be up to 6 pages long, excluding references, and may be followed by a
                clearly
                marked appendix.
            </p>
            <p>We allow to submit short papers about work in progress of up to 2 pages long, excluding references.
            </p>
            <p>Best practices for citations: Alphabetical orderings of authors can lead to biases. Therefore, authors
                are
                encouraged to avoid “et al.” in citations, and instead mention all authors’ names.</p>

            <h4>Reviewing</h4>

            <p>The journal will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the
                identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses
                should
                not appear anywhere in the submission. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the
                submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references
                should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or
                draft versions of their paper as they normally would.For example, authors may post drafts of their
                papers on
                the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on
                double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the representatives of the journal by email.
